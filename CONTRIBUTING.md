I'm currently working to develop a reasonable initial API first. I'd love feedback, especially in the form of a PR to my API spec based on the [tentative data model](https://github.com/johnpickett/simplestack/wiki) I'm working towards.

I'm using [Apicurio Studio](https://studio.apicur.io/) currently and would be happy to send a collaboration invite there as well.
